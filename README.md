# Learnery Example App: "webdev"

Learnery is a rails engine you can use in your rails app to organize open learning events, like railsbridge, barcamps, user groups, meetups, hackathons. You can adapt it to your liking and deploy the app to heroku in a few simple steps.

This example app shows the use of the learnery engine and
gives you a good starting point for building your own app.
